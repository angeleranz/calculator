# Basic Calculator

This was the final project from the Odin Project's foundations module. It made me use almost everything I learned until this point in the project.


## Learnings

This little project made me really stick the knowledge I acquired in past projects and lessons througout the course. The DOM manipulation, Javascript logic and functions and CSS styling.


## Stack

Vanilla Javascript with pure CSS and HTML.


## Demo

Live demo can be found [here](https://angeleranz.github.io/calculator/).
